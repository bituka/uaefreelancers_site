Facebook-SDK-Spark
==============

Facebook-SDK-Spark adds the facebook sdk library to CodeIgniter.

Introduction
------------

The facebook SDK is available for Codeigniter via [Sparks](http://getsparks.org/install).

You'll need to setup and app and get an appID and Secret key from [Facebook](http://developer.facebook.com).

And save this appID and Secret in the '/sparks/Facebook-SDK/[version #]/config/facebook_config.php'.

Once you've got the spark set up, you can load it using:

	$this->load->spark('Facebook-SDK/[version #]');


When Facebook-SDK is loaded, you can make calls to the facebook api as follows.

### Set get login URL

	$this->facebook->getLoginURL();

### Make a Facebook API call

	$this->facebook->api('/codeigniter');

Other documentation for the Facebook PHP SDK can be found at [https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/](https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/).
